- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the term "data scientist" was coined in 2008 by DJ Patil and Jeff Hammerbacher?
              They were working at LinkedIn and Facebook, respectively, and recognized the need for a new role
              to handle the increasing amounts of data generated by these platforms.
              The title "data scientist" has since become widely used, and data science has evolved into a
              crucial field for extracting valuable insights from vast and complex datasets.
